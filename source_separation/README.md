# Source Separation

In this folder I put a exercise passed to me by Dr. Bruno Sokal, here I have
to separate two signals X$_{1}$ and X$_{2}$, the first one is mapped in BPSK
constellation and the second by a 4-QAM. The first problem multiplex the 
signals with a Kronecker Product and in the second one by a Khatri-Rao 
product.

In first I know the first element of Y, and in the second one I know the 
first column of Y. In both problems I have to simulate the separation for
differents Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR). For both problem I generate a graph.

*This codes and the pdf have some uncorrets results. I intend to fix this
later*.
