# Rak-One Detector for Kronecker-Structured Constant Modulus Constellation

In this folder I put my code that try to reproduce the 
[Asim's letter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146283). First I will
generate a code to map a signal $\Phi$ with a N-PSK modulation by taking 
already know mapped signals with M-PSK, where M $\le$ N.
